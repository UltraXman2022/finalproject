<h1>Final Sprint Structure</h1>
In the final sprint, you will apply everything you've learned during a two-week bootcamp that simulates work in a real company. You'll be given several tasks, and members of the Student Guidance Team will be helping you complete them. They're going to be your colleagues for the next 14 days.

<h2>Colleagues</h2>
<ul><li>
The team leader will be giving you tasks and making sure you complete them successfully</li><li>
The project reviewer will review your code. They are independent experts from another department who work in machine learning, but they don't know the details of the task</li></ul>
<br><h2>Tasks</h2>
To complete the final sprint successfully, you'll need a score of five story points (SP). These are conventional units for measuring the task's difficulty. You'll get:
<ul><li>4 to 6 SP for the main project</li>
<li>1 SP for the additional assignment</li>/ul><br>
You're going to build a prototype of a machine learning model following these instructions:
<ul><ol>Make a work plan. When you first see the task, you'll notice that it's incomplete and contains unnecessary information. Perform exploratory data analysis to figure out which questions you need to ask.
<ol>Investigate the task. Ask your team leader any questions you may have.</ol>
<ol>Develop a model. Submit your code to the project reviewer.</ol>
<ol>Prepare a report. Send the report to your team leader so that they can make sure you've completed the tasks correctly.</ol></ul>
The final score depends on the quality of your model.
The additional assignment is based on the same data as the main project.
At the end of the sprint, your code will be reviewed by the team leader.
